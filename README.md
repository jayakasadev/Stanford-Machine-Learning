# Stanford-Machine-Learning

This repo contains the programming assignments completed as part of the Stanford Machine Learning course.
I have taken a personal interest in making sure that all functions and equations scale well regardless of the size of the input. This means that my solutions are usually one-liners and do not need further modification for use with larger equations.
