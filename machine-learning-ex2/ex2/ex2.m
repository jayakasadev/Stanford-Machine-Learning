%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 2: Logistic Regression
%
%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the logistic
%  regression exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     sigmoid.m
%     costFunction.m
%     predict.m
%     costFunctionReg.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Load Data
%  The first two columns contains the exam scores and the third column
%  contains the label.

data = load('ex2data1.txt');
X = data(:, [1, 2]); y = data(:, 3);

%% ==================== Part 1: Plotting ====================
%  We start the exercise by first plotting the data to understand the 
%  the problem we are working with.

fprintf(['Plotting data with + indicating (y = 1) examples and o ' ...
         'indicating (y = 0) examples.\n']);

plotData(X, y);

% Put some labels 
hold on;
% Labels and Legend
xlabel('Exam 1 score')
ylabel('Exam 2 score')

% Specified in plot order
legend('Admitted', 'Not admitted')

hold off;

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ============ Part 2: Compute Cost and Gradient ============
%  In this part of the exercise, you will implement the cost and gradient
%  for logistic regression. You neeed to complete the code in 
%  costFunction.m

%  Setup the data matrix appropriately, and add ones for the intercept term
[m, n] = size(X);

% Add intercept term to x and X_test
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% Initialize fitting parameters
initial_theta = zeros(n + 1, 1);

% Compute and display initial cost and gradient
[cost, grad] = costFunction(initial_theta, X, y);

fprintf('Cost at initial theta (zeros): %f\n', cost);
fprintf('Gradient at initial theta (zeros): \n');
fprintf(' %f \n', grad);

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ============= Part 3: Optimizing using fminunc  =============
%  In this exercise, you will use a built-in function (fminunc) to find the
%  optimal parameters theta.

%  Set options for fminunc
% set the GradObj option to on, which tells fminunc that our function returns both the 
% cost and the gradient
%   --> allows fminunc to use the gradient when minimizing the function. 
% set the MaxIter option to 400, so that fminunc will run for at most 400 steps before it 
% terminates
options = optimset('GradObj', 'on', 'MaxIter', 400);

% fminunc is an optimization solver that finds the minimum of an unconstrained2 function.
% For logistic regression, you want to optimize the cost function J(theta) with 
% parameters theta.
% going to use fminunc to find the best parameters for the logistic regression 
% cost function, given a fixed dataset (of X and y values)

% fmminunc input
%   - initial values of the parameters we are trying to optimize
%   - function that, when given the training set and a particular theta, computes
%     the logistic regression cost and gradient with respect to theta for the dataset
%     (X, y)

%  Run fminunc to obtain the optimal theta
%  This function will return theta and the cost 
% To specify the actual function we are minimizing, we use a "short-hand" for specifying 
% functions with the @(t) ( costFunction(t, X, y) )
%   - This creates a function, with argument t, which calls your costFunction. This allows 
%     us to wrap the costFunction for use with fminunc.

% fminunc will converge on the right optimization parameters and return the final values of 
% the cost and theta. 

% Notice that by using fminunc, you did not have to write any loops yourself, or set a 
% learning rate like you did for gradient descent. This is all done by fminunc: you only 
% needed to provide a function calculating the cost and the gradient


[theta, cost] = fminunc(@(t)(costFunction(t, X, y)), initial_theta, options);

% Print theta to screen
fprintf('Cost at theta found by fminunc: %f\n', cost);
fprintf('theta: \n');
fprintf(' %f \n', theta);

% Plot Boundary
% final theta value will then be used to plot the decision boundary on the training data
plotDecisionBoundary(theta, X, y);

% Put some labels 
hold on;
% Labels and Legend
xlabel('Exam 1 score')
ylabel('Exam 2 score')

% Specified in plot order
legend('Admitted', 'Not admitted')
hold off;

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ============== Part 4: Predict and Accuracies ==============
%  After learning the parameters, you'll like to use it to predict the outcomes
%  on unseen data. In this part, you will use the logistic regression model
%  to predict the probability that a student with score 45 on exam 1 and 
%  score 85 on exam 2 will be admitted.
%
%  Furthermore, you will compute the training and test set accuracies of 
%  our model.
%
%  Your task is to complete the code in predict.m

%  Predict probability for a student with score 45 on exam 1 
%  and score 85 on exam 2 

prob = sigmoid([1 45 85] * theta);
fprintf(['For a student with scores 45 and 85, we predict an admission ' ...
         'probability of %f\n\n'], prob);

% Compute accuracy on our training set
p = predict(theta, X);

fprintf('Train Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(p == y)) * 100);

fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;
