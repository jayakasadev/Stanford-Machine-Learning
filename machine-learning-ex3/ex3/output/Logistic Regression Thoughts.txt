Logistic Regression is a linear classifier. So it cannot form a more 
complex hypothesis.

It seems that the upward bound for accuracy with logistic regression is 
around 95%. Increasing the number of iterations of fmincg does not 
increase the accuracy. In fact, it causes a slight lose in accuracy.

It, also, takes a while for the whole thing to run. 
If it is slow for something basic like digit recognition, then it must be 
very unweildy with a more complex classification problem.
