Using parameters from a neural network that was already trained. The goal 
is to  implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our weights 
or parameters for prediction.

Neural Network has 3 layers
    input layer
    hidden layer
    output layer

Since, the images are 20x20, this gives us 400 inut layer units, excluding 
the extra bias unit which always outputs +1.


Network parameters (Theta1, and Theta2) are already trained. They are 
stored in ex3weights.mat.

The parameters have dimensions that are sized for a neural network with 25 
units in the second layer and 10 output units (corresponding to the 10 
digit classes).

This was much simpler to implement. It was just applying the formula described the class.
